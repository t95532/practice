🩺 Diabetes Prediction Application
1. Introduction
Diabetes is a chronic medical condition that occurs when the body is unable to effectively regulate blood glucose levels. Early prediction and diagnosis of diabetes can help in timely medical intervention and lifestyle management.
This Diabetes Prediction Application is a machine learning–based web application developed using Streamlit, which predicts whether a person is diabetic based on medical input parameters. The prediction model is built using a Random Forest Classifier, optimized through hyperparameter tuning to achieve better accuracy and reliability.

2. Objective
The main objectives of this project are:
To build an accurate machine learning model for diabetes prediction
To apply hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance
To provide a user-friendly web interface for real-time predictions
To deploy the application for public access

3. Dataset Description
The application uses a structured medical dataset containing diagnostic measurements for diabetes prediction.
Features Used:
Pregnancies
Glucose level
Blood Pressure
Skin Thickness
Insulin
Body Mass Index (BMI)
Diabetes Pedigree Function
Age
Target Variable:
Outcome
0 → Non-Diabetic
1 → Diabetic

4. Machine Learning Model
Algorithm Used: Random Forest Classifier
The Random Forest Classifier is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and combines their predictions to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.
Why Random Forest?
Handles both linear and non-linear data well
Robust against overfitting
Performs well with tabular medical data
Provides high accuracy and stability

5. Hyperparameter Tuning
To improve the model’s performance, hyperparameter tuning was performed using techniques such as Grid Search or Randomized Search.
Tuned Parameters:
n_estimators – Number of trees in the forest
max_depth – Maximum depth of each tree
min_samples_split – Minimum samples required to split a node
min_samples_leaf – Minimum samples required at a leaf node
max_features – Number of features considered for splitting
The best parameters were selected based on cross-validation performance, resulting in an optimized and reliable model.
